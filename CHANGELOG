Support for bigrams
Add function `merge` in `counting` module to merge CountBasedRepresentations
Improve working with Tokens
Move evaluate module to new evaluation package
Refactoring of the `count_cooccurrence` method to improve performances

1.0.0 -> 1.0.1
Fix incompatibility with gensim 3

1.0.0-RC6 -> 1.0.0-RC7
Doc updated
Available on pyPI

1.0.0-RC5 -> 1.0.0-RC6

1.0.0-RC3 -> 1.0.0-RC4

Refactorization of the base classes and main function `create` :
    - move the `embeddings` module to a `base` module and import content in root (renaming `magnet.embeddings.create()`
    to `magnet.create_representation()`)
    - rename CooccurrenceCount to CountBasedRepresentation to generalize it and generalize the representation that
    can be used as source in the create_representation()` function
